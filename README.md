### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
##### 1. Multi line synopsis (resolved)
Faced issues with obtaining multiple lines of text for the synopsis. To resolve this issue, removed all constraints on the SynopsisLabel label.

##### 2. Uploading Poster images
Implemented a lot of new concepts. Took time understanding the use of CocoaPod.
